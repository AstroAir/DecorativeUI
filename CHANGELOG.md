## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 0.9.x to 1.0.0

#### Breaking Changes

1. **Namespace Changes**: All classes moved to `DeclarativeUI` namespace
2. **API Refinements**: Some method signatures updated for consistency
3. **Property System**: Enhanced type safety may require code updates

#### Migration Steps

1. Update include paths to use new namespace
2. Review property setting calls for type safety
3. Update event handler registrations to new API
4. Test hot reload functionality with new file watching system

#### Example Migration

```cpp
// Old (0.9.x)
auto button = Button();
button.setText("Click Me");
button.setClickHandler([]() { /* handler */ });

// New (1.0.0)
auto button = std::make_unique<Components::Button>();
button->text("Click Me")
      .onClick([]() { /* handler */ });
button->initialize();
```

### Migrating from 0.5.x to 0.9.x

#### Major Changes

1. Complete rewrite of component system
2. Introduction of JSON UI support
3. New state management system
4. Hot reload functionality added

#### Migration Required

- Complete code rewrite recommended
- New API patterns and best practices
- Updated build system and dependencies
