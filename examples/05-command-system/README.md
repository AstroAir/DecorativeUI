## Learning Path

### Currently Available
1. **Start with:** `command-basics/command-basics-simple.cpp` - Simple command concepts
2. **Then:** `command-basics/command-basics.cpp` - Full command pattern

### When Re-enabled
3. **Advance to:** `command-builder/` - Builder patterns
4. **Explore:** `json-commands/` - Dynamic commands
5. **Master:** `state-integration/` - Advanced integration

## Command System Architecture

### Core Concepts

**Command Pattern**
- Encapsulates requests as objects
- Enables parameterization and queuing
- Supports undo/redo operations
- Decouples invoker from receiver

**Command Types**
- **Simple Commands** - Single operations
- **Composite Commands** - Multiple operations
- **Macro Commands** - Recorded command sequences
- **Conditional Commands** - Context-dependent execution

**Command Lifecycle**
1. **Creation** - Command instantiation
2. **Validation** - Pre-execution checks
3. **Execution** - Command operation
4. **Logging** - Operation recording
5. **Cleanup** - Resource management

### Benefits

**Flexibility**
- Dynamic command creation
- Runtime command composition
- Configurable command behavior
- Extensible command system

**Maintainability**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable command logic
- Reusable command components
- Consistent error handling

**User Experience**
- Undo/redo functionality
- Command history
- Batch operations
- Macro recording

## Best Practices

### Command Design
1. **Keep commands focused** - Single responsibility principle
2. **Make commands immutable** - Avoid side effects
3. **Validate early** - Check preconditions before execution
4. **Handle errors gracefully** - Provide meaningful error messages
5. **Document command contracts** - Clear input/output specifications

### Performance
1. **Lazy execution** - Defer expensive operations
2. **Command pooling** - Reuse command objects
3. **Batch processing** - Group related commands
4. **Memory management** - Clean up command history

### Error Handling
1. **Validation** - Check command validity before execution
2. **Rollback** - Implement proper undo mechanisms
3. **Error reporting** - Provide detailed error information
4. **Recovery** - Handle partial failures gracefully

## Common Patterns

### Basic Command
```cpp
class IncrementCommand : public Command {
public:
    IncrementCommand(int& value) : m_value(value), m_oldValue(value) {}
    
    void execute() override {
        m_value++;
    }
    
    void undo() override {
        m_value = m_oldValue;
    }
    
private:
    int& m_value;
    int m_oldValue;
};
```

### Command Builder (when available)
```cpp
auto command = CommandBuilder()
    .setTarget(widget)
    .setProperty("text", "New Value")
    .setAnimation(true)
    .setDuration(300)
    .build();
```

### JSON Command (when available)
```json
{
    "type": "SetPropertyCommand",
    "target": "mainButton",
    "property": "text",
    "value": "Click Me!",
    "animation": {
        "duration": 200,
        "easing": "easeInOut"
    }
}
```

## Current Status
