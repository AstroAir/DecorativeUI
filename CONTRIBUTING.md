# Contributing to DeclarativeUI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to DeclarativeUI! We welcome contributions from the community and are excited to see what you'll build with us.

## Quick Start

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DeclarativeUI.git
   cd DeclarativeUI
   ```

3. **Set up development environment** (see [Development Setup](#development-setup))
4. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
5. **Make your changes** following our [coding standards](#coding-standards)
6. **Write tests** for your changes
7. **Submit a pull request**

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Qt6** (6.2 or later) with Core, Widgets, Network, and Test modules
- **CMake** 3.20 or higher
- **C++20 compatible compiler** (GCC 10+, Clang 12+, MSVC 2019+)
- **Git**
- **Python 3.8+** (for pre-commit hooks and documentation)

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Create development build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build .

# Run tests to verify setup
ctest --output-on-failure
```

### Pre-commit Setup (Recommended)

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency. After cloning the repository:

```bash
# Install Python dependencies (includes pre-commit)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Optionally, run on all files to check current state
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**What the hooks do:**

- Format C++ code with clang-format
- Format CMake files with cmake-format
- Remove trailing whitespace and fix line endings
- Check for large files and merge conflicts
- Run basic C++ static analysis (cppcheck)

**Bypassing hooks (when necessary):**

```bash
# Skip all hooks for emergency commits
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency fix"

# Skip specific hooks
SKIP=clang-format,cppcheck git commit -m "Skip formatting"
```

For detailed pre-commit setup and troubleshooting, see our [Pre-commit Guide](docs/developer/pre-commit-guide.md).

For detailed setup instructions, see our [Development Guide](docs/developer/contributing.md).

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs or request features
- Search existing issues before creating new ones
- Provide detailed reproduction steps for bugs
- Include system information (OS, Qt version, compiler)

### Submitting Changes

1. **Small changes**: Feel free to submit a PR directly
2. **Large changes**: Please open an issue first to discuss the approach
3. **Breaking changes**: Must be discussed in an issue before implementation

### Types of Contributions

- üêõ **Bug fixes**: Fix issues in existing functionality
- ‚ú® **New features**: Add new components or capabilities
- üìö **Documentation**: Improve docs, examples, or guides
- üß™ **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage
- üé® **Examples**: Create new example applications
- ‚ö° **Performance**: Optimize existing code

## Coding Standards

We follow modern C++20 best practices:

- **Naming**: PascalCase for classes, camelCase for methods, snake_case for variables
- **Memory Management**: Use smart pointers and RAII
- **Error Handling**: Use exceptions for error conditions
- **Documentation**: Document public APIs with Doxygen comments

For detailed coding standards, see [docs/developer/contributing.md](docs/developer/contributing.md).

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure existing tests continue to pass
- Add integration tests for complex features
- Include performance tests for critical paths

## Documentation

- Update relevant documentation for your changes
- Add examples for new features
- Update API documentation for public interfaces
- Consider adding tutorials for complex features

## Code Review Process

1. All submissions require review from a maintainer
2. Automated checks must pass (CI, tests, linting)
3. Address all feedback before merge
4. Squash commits if requested

## Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Help others learn and grow
- Share knowledge and best practices
- Celebrate successes and learn from failures

## Getting Help

- üìñ **Documentation**: Check [docs/](docs/) for comprehensive guides
- üí¨ **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for questions
- üêõ **Issues**: Report bugs or request features
- üìß **Contact**: Reach out to maintainers for complex questions

## Recognition

Contributors are recognized in:

- CHANGELOG.md for their contributions
- README.md contributors section
- Release notes for significant contributions

Thank you for helping make DeclarativeUI better! üöÄ
