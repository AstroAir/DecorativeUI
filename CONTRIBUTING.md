- **Git**

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Create development build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build .

# Run tests to verify setup
ctest --output-on-failure
```

For detailed setup instructions, see our [Development Guide](docs/developer/contributing.md).
